# WikiJS Provider

The WikiJS provider aims to implement the complete GraphQL API of WikiJS.
It should be possible to configure any instance of WikiJS via this provider.
The main focus is for administration backend to be complete but also provide necessary resources and data_source to aid with that.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Minimal example how to use the provider

terraform {
  required_providers {
    wikijs = {
      source  = "tyclipso/wikijs"
      version = "~> 1"
    }
  }
}

provider "wikijs" {
  site_url = "https://wiki.example.com"
}
```

## Configure a login for elevated rights

```terraform
# If you want to edit content or administer the wiki
# you need to login

terraform {
  required_providers {
    wikijs = {
      source  = "tyclipso/wikijs"
      version = "~> 1"
    }
    random = {
      source = "hashicorp/random"
    }
  }
}

# You can generate a random password and send it to the /finalize
# endpoint after starting a wikijs instance
resource "random_password" "wikijs_admin_password" {
  length = 32
}

provider "wikijs" {
  site_url = "https://wiki.example.com"
  email    = "admin@wiki.example.com"
  password = random_password.wikijs_admin_password.result
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `site_url` (String) Wiki.JS Site URL

### Optional

- `email` (String) Email to login with
- `password` (String) Password to login with

## Limitations

Some resources that can be created with this provider, like `wikijs_auth_strategies`, have "secret" attributes and as such are marked by this provider as _sensitive_, so to help practitioner to not accidentally leak their value in logs or other form of output.

It's important to remember that the values that constitute the "state" of those resources will be stored in the [Terraform state](https://www.terraform.io/language/state) file.
This includes the "secrets", that will be part of the state file _unencrypted_.

Because of these limitations, **use of these resources for production deployments is _not_ recommended**.
Failing that, **protecting the content of the state file is strongly recommended**.

The more general advice is that it's better to generate "secrets" outside of Terraform, and then distribute them securely to the system where Terraform will make use of them.
