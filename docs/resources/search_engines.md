  The wikijs_search_engines Resource implements the WikiJS API mutatation search{updateSearchEngines{engines{…}}}.
  Be aware.
  This Resource supports only one instance as the implementation needs the complete configuration of search engines.
  You cannot specify one search engine with its config as this will erase the complete list.
  If you are unsure about the key and config fields, you can query the API after activating it manually or with the wikijs_api resource.
  Make sure that the search provider isAvailable before you try to set isEnabled and that you have always exactly one search engine enabled.
  The query with the minimal information you need is as follows:
  graphql
  query{
    search{
      searchEngines{
        title,
        key,
        isEnabled,
        isAvailable,
        config{
          key,
          value
        }
      }  }
  }
  
  The title field is not needed in the wikijs_search_engines Resource but is necessary for the graphql query.
  You get back a JSON in the config.value field where you have to look for another value field.

# wikijs_search_engines (Resource)

The `wikijs_search_engines` Resource implements the WikiJS API mutatation `search{updateSearchEngines{engines{…}}}`.

**Be aware**.
This Resource supports only one instance as the implementation needs the complete configuration of search engines.
You cannot specify one search engine with its config as this will erase the complete list.
If you are unsure about the `key` and `config` fields, you can query the API after activating it manually or with the `wikijs_api` resource.
Make sure that the search provider `isAvailable` before you try to set `isEnabled` and that you have always exactly one search engine enabled.
The query with the minimal information you need is as follows:

```graphql
query{
  search{
    searchEngines{
      title,
      key,
      isEnabled,
      isAvailable,
      config{
        key,
        value
      }
    }  }
}
```

The `title` field is not needed in the `wikijs_search_engines` Resource but is necessary for the graphql query.
You get back a JSON in the `config.value` field where you have to look for another `value` field.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# This is a _currently_ complete configuration for the search_engines.
# The order of this example is as it can be found in the backend for
# easier working.
