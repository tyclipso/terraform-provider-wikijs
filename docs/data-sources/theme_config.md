# wikijs_theme_config (Data Source)

The `wikijs_theme_config` Data Source implements the WikiJS API query `theming{config{…}}`.
It can be used to read the current state and only change one of the required or any of the optional, without touching the required.
The Schema descriptions are directly lifted from the descriptions of the input fields in WikiJS.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# This data_source can be useful if you want to change only one of the
# required theme configs but don't want to change the rest

# Notice that this data source does not take any arguments
data "wikijs_theme_config" "config" {}

resource "wikijs_theme_config" "config" {
  theme   = data.wikijs_theme_config.config.theme
  iconset = data.wikijs_theme_config.data.iconset
  # Only switch dark mode globally on
  dark_mode = true
}
```

## Schema

### Read-Only

- `dark_mode` (Boolean) Dark Mode.
  Not recommended for accessibility.
  May not be supported by all themes.
- `iconset` (String) Set of icons to use for the sidebar navigation.
- `inject_body` (String) HTML code to be injected just before the closing body tag.
- `inject_css` (String) CSS code to inject after system default CSS.
  Consider using custom themes if you have a large amount of css code.
  Injecting too much CSS code will result in poor page load performance!
  CSS will automatically be minified.
  
  **CAUTION**: When adding styles for page content, you must scope them to the `.contents` class.
  Omitting this could break the layout of the editor!
- `inject_head` (String) HTML code to be injected just before the closing head tag.  Usually for script tags.
- `theme` (String) Themes affect how content pages are displayed.
  Other site sections (such as the editor or admin area) are not affected.
- `toc_position` (String) Select whether the table of contents is shown on the left, right or not at all.
