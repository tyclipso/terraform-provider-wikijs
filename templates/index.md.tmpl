## Limitations

Some resources that can be created with this provider, like `wikijs_auth_strategies`, have "secret" attributes and as such are marked by this provider as _sensitive_, so to help practitioner to not accidentally leak their value in logs or other form of output.

It's important to remember that the values that constitute the "state" of those resources will be stored in the [Terraform state](https://www.terraform.io/language/state) file.
This includes the "secrets", that will be part of the state file _unencrypted_.

Because of these limitations, **use of these resources for production deployments is _not_ recommended**.
Failing that, **protecting the content of the state file is strongly recommended**.

The more general advice is that it's better to generate "secrets" outside of Terraform, and then distribute them securely to the system where Terraform will make use of them.
