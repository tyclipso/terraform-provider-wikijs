# Terraform Provider Wiki.js Examples

In this directory the example terraform files are stored.
If you are expanding those please be aware of the current convention.

## Linelength: 72

The `code` block on the terraform registry is roughly 77 characters wide in fullscreen before starting to overflow.
Unfortunately this is even below old style 80 characters width.
To minimise the overflow we instated the convention to limit the example files around 72 characters as this is also the recommended length of a git commit body.
