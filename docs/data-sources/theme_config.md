# wikijs_theme_config (Data Source)





<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Read-Only

- `dark_mode` (Boolean) Dark Mode. Not recommended for accessibility. May not be supported by all themes.
- `iconset` (String) Set of icons to use for the sidebar navigation. Values: mdi, fa, fa4
- `inject_body` (String) HTML code to be injected just before the closing body tag.
- `inject_css` (String) CSS code to inject after system default CSS. Consider using custom themes if you have a large amount of css code.
Injecting too much CSS code will result in poor page load performance! CSS will automatically be minified.
CAUTION: When adding styles for page content, you must scope them to the .contents class. Omitting this could break the layout of the editor!
- `inject_head` (String) HTML code to be injected just before the closing head tag. Usually for script tags.
- `theme` (String) Themes affect how content pages are displayed. Other site sections (such as the editor or admin area) are not affected.
- `toc_position` (String) Select whether the table of contents is shown on the "left", "right" or not at all ("off").
