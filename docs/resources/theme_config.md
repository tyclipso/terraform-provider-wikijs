# wikijs_theme_config (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
# The following example shows how to configure the wikijs theme
# Since v2 of Wiki.js does not allow for dynamic addition of
# custom themes you need to provide your own string there

resource "wikijs_theme_config" "config" {
  theme     = "custom_name"
  iconset   = "mdi"
  dark_mode = true
}

# If you want to change the iconset currently the provider only supports
# the builtin names:
# Material Design Icons: "mdi"
# Font Awesome: "fa"
# Font Awesome 4: "fa4"

resource "wikijs_theme_config" "config" {
  theme     = "default"
  iconset   = "mdi"
  dark_mode = false
}

# The provider has a builtin default theme_config that is set with the
# WikiJS setup. This config will be used for any Delete and a resource
# representation looks like this

resource "wikijs_theme_config" "config" {
  theme        = "default"
  iconset      = "mdi"
  dark_mode    = false
  toc_position = "left"
  inject_css   = ""
  inject_head  = ""
  inject_body  = ""
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `dark_mode` (Boolean) Dark Mode. Not recommended for accessibility. May not be supported by all themes.
- `iconset` (String) Set of icons to use for the sidebar navigation. Values: mdi, fa, fa4
- `theme` (String) Themes affect how content pages are displayed. Other site sections (such as the editor or admin area) are not affected.

### Optional

- `inject_body` (String) HTML code to be injected just before the closing body tag.
- `inject_css` (String) CSS code to inject after system default CSS. Consider using custom themes if you have a large amount of css code.
Injecting too much CSS code will result in poor page load performance! CSS will automatically be minified.
CAUTION: When adding styles for page content, you must scope them to the .contents class. Omitting this could break the layout of the editor!
- `inject_head` (String) HTML code to be injected just before the closing head tag. Usually for script tags.
- `toc_position` (String) Select whether the table of contents is shown on the "left", "right" or not at all ("off").
